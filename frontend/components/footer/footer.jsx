                    Hello, welcome to my site, In-Tents. My name is Michelle and I am a software engineer based in SF.
                    <br />
                    I enjoy being in nature and wanted to bring that bit of passion for hiking and exploring
                    <br />
                    into my personal project. I hope you find the pictures enjoyable and the experience, satisfying.

                    <br />
                    God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass - grows in silence;
                    <br />
                    see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence...
                    <br />
                    We need silence to be able to touch souls."
